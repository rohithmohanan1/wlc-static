Most of the students are confused and unaware of the preparations they might have to do to kick start their career in a global setting. It is indeed one of WLC's goals to create global speakers who can survive (THRIVE) on their own in an international work setting. We believe that it is best to groom them young to make them productive members of reputed organizations around the world. We have research-oriented methodologies to gain maximum international exposure to the student communities in India"
